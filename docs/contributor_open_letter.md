# Open Letter to Developers

"Spring river water warm duck knows first, just when pufferfish wants to go up!"

Dear friend, I am John, an ordinary Java programmer in a company. Today, I write this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation with a sincere heart.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects, such as `Dify`, `Chat2DB` and other AI-related projects. I thought, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "报国无门，空打十年代码" (no way to serve the country, coding in vain for ten years).

I came across Brother Xia's team's video in early 2025, and I was very curious about how they achieved it. I wanted to replicate their backend service and create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, the work I've done is still just an artificial idiot - it has low concurrency, no soul, slow response, and many bugs.

Brother Xia's team is our learning target. I really want to have a smart Xiaozhi backend service like Brother Xia's team. But I can also understand Brother Xia's decision not to open source. "一花独放不是春，百花齐放春满园" (A single flower does not make spring, a hundred flowers blooming make spring full of gardens). The era of AI blooming everywhere may be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to realize a low-cost civilian Jarvis. I personally think that what he can achieve, we can also achieve, it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to obtain the scriptures".

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey to obtain the scriptures? I think there should be no less than eighty-one difficulties. Along the way, there will inevitably be various monsters, of course there will also be immortals helping us in secret, and people joining the journey team.

If you find the above content funny, then I also feel very lucky. I was able to make you laugh for five seconds in your 30,000+ days of life, which can be considered a contribution to you.

Will this idea of a civilian low-cost Jarvis fail? I don't know, but in our ordinary lives, isn't this kind of failure very common?

In the future, one thing is certain - someone will completely replicate Brother Xia's team's functionality and realize a civilian low-cost Jarvis. Will this project be us?

Looking forward to walking hand in hand with you and creating the future together.

# Appendix: Development Contribution Guide
## Project Goals

1. **Civilian Low-Cost Jarvis Solution**  

2. **Intelligent Linkage Solution for Peripheral Hardware**  

## Join Us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join and contribute to the project together. You can view the features we plan to implement recently at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). Features in the list that haven't been assigned to anyone are exactly what we urgently need your participation in. Participation methods are as follows:

### 1. Become a Regular Contributor

Fork the project, submit PR, reviewed by developers and merged into the main branch.

### 2. Become a Developer

When you have accumulated 3 valid PRs, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join an independent developer group to discuss the project's future together.

## Developer Development Process

1. **Create New Branch**  
   Each feature point should be developed in a new branch. Branch names should be concise and clear, so people can see what functionality is implemented at a glance, avoiding feature conflicts.

2. **Submit PR for Review**  
   After feature development is complete, please submit a PR on GitHub for other developers to review. After review passes, merge into the main branch.
